# Tenzies

This is a web app game whose goal is to roll until dices are all the same in the shortest time possible

# Usage

- Start by clicking up a die to lock its value
- Click up roll button to roll
- Once all same numbers are locked, you've reached the goal and your current time will be shown. Also your initial time and future best time will be saved on your local storage and your best time will be shown
- Have fun!
